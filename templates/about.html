                    <p>My name is Daniel Shaanan, and this project was created by me for a problem i wanted to solve.<br>
                    The problem i wanted to solve is that you cannot share playlists between music services, And this site solves exactly this problem. <br>
                    for now the site supports only from Apple Music playlist to Spotify playlist.<br>
                    Just login with your spotify account, pick a playlist name, description, privacy setting, and enter the Apple Music playlist URL you wish to exchange.
